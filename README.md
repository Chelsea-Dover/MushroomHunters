## Overview
Morels is mainly a card game consisting of six different types of cards as well as Stick Tokens. The deck will consist of Night Cards, Mushroom Cards, Cider and Butter Cards, Frying Pan Cards, and Moon Cards. There will also be Stick Tokens that they can buy with their Mushroom Cards. 
There will be visuals of the actual Morels game and movable objects. Users will be able to drag their cards to organize their hand, drag their cards to play, and keep track of their points from a score tally somewhere on the board.

## Why I chose Morels
I found Morels about a year ago and ever since then I’ve been hooked! I wanted to share and enjoy it with my online community, but sadly couldn’t since everyone is overseas. When the time came to choose a project for my final assignment I really wanted to make something that I could enjoy with my online community, so I decided on Morels because it’s one of my favorite games. I’m hoping to expand the website to create more multiplayer games that user from all over the world can play and enjoy.
